          <h1>Overview</h1>

          <h2>Can people change their behaviour towards identity protection?</h2>

          <p>
            Secure Sentinel is a leading provider of proactive identity, privacy, and credit protection to help keep people’s identity safe. Secure Sentinel’s main focus is to reduce the risk and impact of loss and theft of their possessions for its members by actively working to educate and empower them to protect themselves against the dangers of identity theft.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our goal was to research and explore ways in which we could help change customer behaviour to be more proactive in their identity protection.

          <h1>The problem</h1>

          <h2>There is no point having a library if no one reads the book inside</h2>

          <p>
            Secure Sentinel has a lot of best practice knowledge on its site, but needs ways to reach their customers more actively and motivate behaviour change from them. By doing so, customers would feel more secure and happy, and Secure Sentinel would be able to reduce identity recovery claims, resulting in more money being saved for everyone.
          </p>

          <p>
            We found that Secure Sentinel’s customers would visit their site for two main reasons:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>When they first sign up to Secure Sentinel</li>
            <li>When they need to make an identity recovery claim</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            This meant that their customer's main goal in visiting the site was not to look up knowledge on how to protect themselves. So, we needed to find ways to incentivise their customers to access the knowledge to start being educated in ways that would encourage them to change their behaviour towards identity protection.
          </p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="caseStudy">
      <div id="solution" class="container">

          <h1>Proposed solution</h1>

          <h2>Prevention is better than cure</h2>

          <p>
            We found that the two reasons why people visited the site correlated to when their motivations were at its highest in terms of wanting to protect their identities. So to leverage off this, we ideated that by teaching customers through an educational onboarding experience after they signed up to the service, they would be more likely to take in the best practice knowledge and understand why it is important.
          </p>

          <p>
            To make the information more accessible we thought to provide customers with a platform that contained useful tools which could help increase their protection from potential threats. We looked at which tools would be easiest to implement and use while having the highest impact, landing on VPNs and password managers. Integrating tools that would be used on a daily basis would drive higher levels of customer engagement with the platform, where useful information could be served in digestible snippets.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, our solution was to create an educational onboarding experience coupled with streamlined online security services including a VPN and Password Manager.

          <h1>Understanding the business and the competitors</h1>

          <h2>Emerging trends in the field</h2>

          <p>
            We first began by looking to define the problem, so we created a business model canvas to see what the business was actually doing. We pinpointed two key business focus areas, customer relationship and key activities, to help us in understanding how the business interacts with its customers through their activities. We realised:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Secure Sentinel places a large emphasis on identity recovery.
            </li>
            <li>
              By focusing on prevention and protection we can reduce the need for identity recovery
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Next, we looked at what competitors in the market were doing and noticed a growing trend amongst identity protection services in providing VPNs. Another simple but effective way to keep people protected was through password managers. Noone in the market seemed to have gotten on board with them yet, even though many sole password managers or VPN providers were coupling the two together.

                Through surveys we were able to find out what people are actually doing. Using Fogg’s behaviour model as a basis, we decided to ask questions that would help us in:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>Determining the level people placed on the importance and motivations on protecting themselves.</li>
                <li>Finding out what people actually did in order to protect themselves in correlation to their motivations.</li>
                <li>How people remembered to do a given task in order to help find ways to help prompt them to practice good behaviours in order to protect themselves.</li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                We honed this down with user interviews targeting those who were concerned about their safety but unsure what to do about it.

          <h2>The why behind the what</h2>

          <p>
            After finding out what people were doing, we went on to find out the why behind the what. Through affinity mapping we were able to organise the answers from the survey into patterns that revealed larger trends to gain insights. So what were some of these key insights? We found that unsurprisingly the majority of people were concerned about their security. But on the contrary, most people didn’t do much to protect themselves. This was due to people either not being informed on how to correctly protect themselves or people simply didn’t know what tools to use.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another thing we found was that even the simple process of frequently updating one’s password created feelings of annoyance and frustration, even when knowing the importance of it. This was due to passwords being hard to remember or it being inconvenient as most people use one password for all their accounts.
