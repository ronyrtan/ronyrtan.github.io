          <h2>How might we change people's behaviour towards identity protection?</h2>

          <p>
            Secure Sentinel is a leading provider of identity, privacy, and credit protection to help keep people’s identity safe. Secure Sentinel’s main focus is to reduce the risk and impact of loss and theft of their possessions for its members by actively working to educate and empower them to protect themselves against the dangers of identity theft.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our goal was to research and explore ways in which we could help change customer behaviour to be more proactive in their identity protection.

          <h1>The problem</h1>

          <h2>There is no point having a library if no one reads the book inside</h2>

          <p>
            Secure Sentinel has a lot of best practice knowledge on its site, but needs ways to reach their customers more actively and motivate behaviour change from them. By doing so, customers would be more secure, and Secure Sentinel would be able to reduce identity recovery claims, resulting in more money being saved for everyone.
          </p>

          <p>
            We found that Secure Sentinel’s customers would visit their site for two main reasons:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>When they first sign up to Secure Sentinel</li>
            <li>When they need to make an identity recovery claim</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            This meant that their customer’s main goal in visiting the site was not to look up information on how to protect themselves. So, we needed to find ways to incentivise their customers to find other ways to engage with customers to start educating them in ways that would encourage behaviour change towards identity protection.

          <h1>Proposed solution</h1>

          <h2>Being proactive is better than being reactive</h2>

          <p>
            We found that the two reasons why people visited the site correlated to when their motivations were at its highest in terms of wanting to protect their identities. So to leverage this, we hypothesised that by equipping customers with valuable services and tools that they didn’t already have, coupled with an educational onboarding experience, they would be more likely to proactively protect themselves.
          </p>

          <p>
            To make the information more accessible we thought to provide customers with a platform that contained valuable tools that people needed, in order to help increase their protection from potential threats. We looked at which tools would be easiest to implement and use while having the highest impact, landing on VPNs and password managers. Integrating tools that would be used on a daily basis would drive higher levels of customer engagement with the platform, where useful information could be served in digestible snippets.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our solution was to create a platform that streamlined online security services, including a password manager and VPN, coupled with an educational onboarding experience.

          <h1>Understanding the business and the competitors</h1>

          <h2>I can’t remember my password</h2>

          <p>
            We first began by looking to define the problem, so we created a business model canvas to see what the business was actually doing. We pinpointed two key business focus areas, customer relationship and key activities, to help us understand how the business interacts with its customers. We realised:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Secure Sentinel places a large emphasis on identity recovery
            </li>
            <li>
              By focusing on prevention and being proactive we can reduce the need for identity recovery
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Next, we looked at what competitors in the market were doing and noticed a growing trend amongst identity protection services providing VPNs. Another simple but effective way to keep people protected was through password managers. Competitors in the market have not adopted both VPNs and password managers, yet many stand alone password managers or VPN providers were coupling the two together.

          <h1>What are people doing?</h1>

          <h2>People don't always act on things they consider important</h2>


          <p>
            Through surveys we were able to find out what people are actually doing around identity protection. We determined Fogg’s behaviour model to be an ideal model to help us in thinking of ways to motivate users to change their behaviour to reflect best practices. Through Fogg’s behaviour model, we can see how highly motivated people will be more willing to perform harder tasks to accomplish a goal. Using Fogg’s behaviour model as a basis, we asked questions that would help us in:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Determining the level of <strong>importance</strong> and <strong>motivation</strong> people placed on protecting themselves.</li>
            <li>Finding out what people actually did in order to <strong>protect themselves</strong> in correlation with their <strong>motivations</strong>.</li>
            <li>How people <strong>remember</strong> to do a given task in order to help find ways to <strong>prompt</strong> them to practice good behaviours.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            We honed this down with user interviews targeting those who were concerned about their safety but unsure what to do about it.

            After finding out what people were doing, we went on to find out the why behind the what. Through affinity mapping we were able to organise the answers from the survey into patterns that revealed larger trends to gain insights. We found that:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>The majority of people were concerned about their security</li>
            <li>Most people didn’t do much to protect themselves</li>
            <ul>
              <li>People were not informed on how to correctly protect themselves</li>
              <li>People didn’t know what tools to use</li>

            <ul>

              <li>Inconvenient as most people used one password across all accounts</li>

          <h2>Concerned but confused</h2>

          <p>
            To understand which types of customers we were designing for, we used our insights to generate three main archetypes. This helped to inform our group of which archetype was best to target by comparing their needs and identifying who would most benefit from our proposed solution.

      <p>
        The Concerned but Confused archetype is already motivated but just don’t know what to do, so through proper education, they would be more willing to perform harder tasks if needed to accomplish their goals. In relation to Fogg’s behaviour model, we found that the Concerned but Confused archetype to be the ideal target.

        <h1>Understanding the customer journey</h1>

        <h2>How can we improve the experience?</h2>

        <p>
          We created a customer journey map to visualise the current process of protecting a customer’s identity after a potential threat. This allowed us to understand the customer’s needs and activities before, during and after they received a notice of a potential threat, on the current Secure Sentinel website.
        </p>

        <p>
          We identified the potential to eliminate several steps altogether associated with the negative emotions around changing passwords. Effective tools such as a password manager would make it easy for customers to manage and store their passwords. It was also made clear that the alert information had to be front and centre as soon as the customer logged into the app.

        <h1>Hypotheses</h1>

        <h2>Hypothesis One - Satisfying User Goals</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>If</strong> we provide convenient tools such as a VPN and password manager on a easy to access platform.<br/>
          <strong>Then</strong> there will be an increase in customers proactivity towards managing their online security.<br/>
          <strong>Because</strong> customers will no longer experience the hassle and frustration associated with password security and connecting to unsecured networks.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer50"></div>


        <h2>Hypothesis Two - Satisfying Business Goals</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>If</strong> we provide an easily accessible education resource and onboarding process.<br/>
          <strong>Then</strong> there would be fewer identity recovery claims.<br/>
          <strong>Because</strong> the more educated customers are, the more likely they are to be proactive about their online security.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer50"></div>

        <h1>Solution</h1>
        <h2>Give people what they need to succeed</h2>
        <p>
          A platform that streamlines online security services, including a password manager and VPN, coupled with an educational onboarding experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were a few reasons why we proposed an app instead of a website. Such things as people being able to access some features, such as their data on the app like their passports or security notes without the need of internet. Also, being able to take advantage of a phones security features such as fingerprint scanning and face ID, allows for that extra level of security.

        <h2>User flows and wireframes</h2>

        <p>
          To get a high level overview of our proposed solution we created a system map to see how our proposed app could sit alongside the existing website. We then created three scenarios that would cover all aspects of the proposed system and translated them into user flows.

        <h2>Onboarding</h2>

        <p>
          When a customer opens the app for the first time they are greeted by an educational onboarding experience. Education makes information clearer and more understandable to people, enabling them to make better decisions when using a product or service. Through onboarding, small snippets of information can be easily digested to familiarise people when learning to use new tools. This was an important aspect of our solution that was inline with our goals of finding ways to promote behaviour change within Secure Sentinel’s customers.

          Within the vault, users are able to see the four different types of items they can save. Icons appear next to each item name to help customers discern the type with a quick glance. When updating a password, customers can tap on the password field to create a new password field. With three more taps, customers are able to easily generate a new strong password and update the item with the new password.

We wanted to make sure through visual queues and text, that the customer would be able to intuitively use the VPN and be safe.

        <p>
          From our proposed solution and prototype, we were able to create a new customer journey map showing how the customer journey has improved. Overlaying the new map onto the old one, we were able to more easily see how anxiety felt with step 5 and 6 have been now been removed since every account now has a discrete unique password. Also because a phone app provides more safety options such as biometric authentication, the customers feel safer and more protected.

        <h2>Key Learnings</h2>

        <p><strong>Always seek feedback from multiple users</strong></p>
        <p>
          This project taught me the importance of getting feedback at all stages. Even when everything seemed simple and easy to understand, users may feel differently. The wireframes and prototype went to 5 different iterations not includes the sketches, due to important user feedback from the usability tests. User feedback can also really help in creating a more accessible solution.

        <p><strong>Importance of onboarding</strong></p>
        <p>
          When designing, it is easy to jump straight into creating screens for the product and services we are providing. A lot of times we forget about the onboarding process, as being the ones to implement such tools into the proposed solution, we take the knowledge of how to use such tools for granted. Through this project I learnt the importance of onboarding and how you should never assume that the end users will know how to effectively use the product or service you provide.
